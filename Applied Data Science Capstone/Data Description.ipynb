    "The goal of this project is the segmentation, exploration and clustering of neighborhoods in Toronto. The key data for this task to be achieved is the Toronto neighborhood data. The structured data for this purpose is not readily available on the inter-net in structured format. Therefore we will scrap the data from the inter-net using scraping libraries in python to achieve a structured dataset from Wikipedia Toronto neighborhood data page which contains all the necessary information needed for this project. The structured dataset should contain the latitudes and longitudes of the each and every neighborhood for exploring and analyzing further venues. The data needs to be cleaned and prepared and the key information factors will be needed in the final recommendation report to the management. The following data is critical for the project:\n",
